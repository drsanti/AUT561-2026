# **Week 3: Programming Foundations and Node-RED Introduction**

> Learning Python programming fundamentals and Node-RED flow-based programming for IoT and automation system development.

---

## 📖 **Week 3 Overview**

This week introduces **programming foundations** essential for automation engineers working with IoT systems. You will learn Python programming fundamentals for data handling, sensor simulation, and control logic, as well as Node-RED flow-based programming for automation-style data flow and visualization. This week provides the foundation for Quiz 1 and prepares you for building complete IoT systems in later weeks.

### **Hands-On Workshops**

Week 3 workshops are split into two parts:

1. **[Week 3 Workshop 1: Python Fundamentals](./Week03-Workshops01.md)** - Python foundations for IoT automation
   * Python project setup and virtual environment
   * Sensor simulation using random and time.sleep
   * Alarm logic and threshold checking
   * File I/O and CSV data logging
   * Data processing (min/max/avg calculations)
   * Optional keyboard-controlled monitoring

2. **[Week 3 Workshop 2: Node-RED Automation](./Week03-Workshops02.md)** - Node-RED flow-based programming
   * Continuous sensor simulation with periodic sampling
   * Threshold logic and state management (NORMAL/WARNING/ALARM)
   * Actuator control simulation (fan/relay ON/OFF)
   * Alarm event logging to files
   * Optional dashboard creation for monitoring

Each workshop includes step-by-step instructions, verification steps, and self-check tasks.
