# **Week 2: Software Installation and Development Environment Setup**

> Setting up your development environment with Visual Studio Code, Python, Node-RED, Docker Desktop, and ModusToolbox for IoT and automation system development.

---

## 📖 **Week 2 Overview**

This week focuses on **setting up your development environment** for building IoT and automation systems. You will install and configure essential software tools including Visual Studio Code (IDE), Python (programming language), Node-RED (flow-based programming), Docker Desktop (containerization platform), and ModusToolbox (embedded development). Understanding these tools is critical for developing reliable IoT applications and embedded systems.
