# **AUT561: Internet-of-Things Technologies**

## Course Overview

This course introduces the principles and applications of **Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies** through **three progressive architecture models**: (1) **Simulated IoT Systems** using Docker, Node-RED, and MQTT for foundational concepts; (2) **Hardware-Based IoT Systems** with PSoC 6 MCU and embedded programming; and (3) **Full-Stack IoT Applications** integrating mobile apps, server-side processing, and AI/ML capabilities. Students will gain both **theoretical knowledge** and **practical programming skills**, progressing from simulation to real hardware implementation and advanced full-stack development with intelligent data processing.

The course is delivered using a **hybrid learning format**, combining **onsite** and **online** instruction. Each session includes **lectures** alongside **hands-on programming activities**.

## Course Description

This course covers the principles and applications of **Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies** through a progressive three-model learning approach. Topics include **Internet networks and wireless communication protocols**, **client-server systems**, **MQTT and other IoT communication protocols**, **operations of IoT devices**, **database systems for IoT data storage**, **real-time data processing and visualization**, and **designing and applying IoT systems in industrial automation**.

The course progresses through three architecture models: (1) **Simulated IoT Systems** focusing on foundational concepts using containerized environments, Node-RED, and MQTT; (2) **Hardware-Based IoT Systems** introducing embedded systems programming with PSoC 6 microcontrollers, sensor integration, and real-time device communication; and (3) **Full-Stack IoT Applications** covering mobile app development, server-side processing, AI/ML integration, and complete end-to-end IoT solutions. Emphasis is placed on **hands-on implementation**, **real-world applications**, and **scalable system design** for industrial and automation environments.
