## Programming Examination Scoring Policy

The **programming portion** of Quiz 1 (and Quiz 2, Quiz 3) uses a **submission-order** scoring policy when AI tools are allowed. You should read the full policy before the quiz.

**[→ Read the full Scoring Policy](./Scoring-Policy.md)**

### Summary

* **AI tools:** You may use AI tools to help develop code during the programming examination.
* **Submission order matters:** Your **submission time** is part of the evaluation. Submitting **earlier** (among valid submissions) gives a **score advantage**.
* **How it works:** Your **base score** is multiplied by a **multiplier** based on submission order:
  * **1st – 7th:** multiplier **1.0**
  * **8th – 15th:** multiplier **0.9**
  * **16th and onward:** multiplier **0.8**

*Final score = Base score × Multiplier.*
