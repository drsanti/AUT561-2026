# Week 5: Simulated IoT Systems Using Node-RED and MQTT

Week 5 has **four main topics**. Complete the reading first, then work through the workshop in order. All four topics build a complete simulated IoT system: MQTT broker, Python clients, sensor simulators, and Node-RED as an MQTT client.

## Four topics

1. **MQTT Broker using Docker** – [Read](./Week05-Read.md#1-mqtt-broker-using-docker) · [Workshop Part 1](./Week05-Workshops.md#part-1-mqtt-broker-using-docker)
2. **MQTT Client using Python** – [Read](./Week05-Read.md#2-mqtt-client-using-python) · [Workshop Part 2](./Week05-Workshops.md#part-2-mqtt-client-using-python)
3. **Sensor Simulators (Python MQTT client)** – [Read](./Week05-Read.md#3-sensor-simulators-python-mqtt-client) · [Workshop Part 3](./Week05-Workshops.md#part-3-sensor-simulators-python-mqtt-client)
4. **Node-RED application as MQTT client** – [Read](./Week05-Read.md#4-node-red-application-as-mqtt-client) · [Workshop Part 4](./Week05-Workshops.md#part-4-node-red-application-as-mqtt-client)
